About
-----
I wrote this app as a project to become familiar with the Laravel framework. I used Laravel 5.2, along with several composer packages including:

* graham-campbell/markdown : provides a markdown editor integrated with bootstrap
* rtconner/laravel-tagging : provides database and methods for tagging objects in Laravel

What I learned
--------------
* Laravel basic MVC organization, including views, routes, controllers, middleware, requests
* managing dependencies using Composer
* basics of working with sqlite3
* working with Laravel views, passing data to views
* working with Laravel authentication
* sorting & filtering Laravel database search results
* practice working with bootstrap

Special Thanks
--------------
Special thanks to Jeffery Way at <http://www.laracasts.com> for the helpful instructional videos about Laravel.
